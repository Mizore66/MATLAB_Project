The main purpose of this project was to practice my MATLAB skills, so I asked around for a problem I can solve with the language.

What I was given was to process the data in .csv and a .xlsx file which contains the amount of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths that were counted throughout most countries and continents all over the world. (These are in files Q1a-Q1c)

Another problem given was to calculate the trajectory of a tennis ball after a certain amount of topspin was applied to the swing. (These are in files Q2a-Q2c).

After these two exercises, I can say I have improved my proficiency in MATLAB and understand the syntax quite well
